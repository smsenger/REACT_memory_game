# Memory Game

This application presents users with 16 cards. The cards come in pairs that contain the same image. To play, the user must select a card and try to find its match. To win, the user must find all pairs. Once the user has won, a new game is loaded.

## Design

This game is responsive, meaning that users with many screen sizes can enjoy playing it. The design of the game is also meant to engage the user's sense of humor, with a cat image on the back side of each card (see below).

## Minimum Viable Product
The initial goal of this game was to allow a user to play the memory game. I added the feature of resetting the game once the user has won. I also added a counter at the bottom of the page that allows the user to keep track of how many games he/she has won.
